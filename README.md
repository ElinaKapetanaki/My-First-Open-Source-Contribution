# My-First-Open-Source-Contribution

I contributed by creating a **Zotero handler** for **MindsDB**, allowing seamless integration of bibliographic data with AI-powered queries.

- MindsDB - AI-powered database integration
- Zotero - Reference management
- Open Source Collaboration

Excited to contribute more to open-source projects!

In folders **1, 2, 3** are my progress presentations in the course "Software Engineering in Practice".
