# My-First-Open-Source-Contribution

I contributed by creating a **Zotero handler** (Research material and Reference management) for **MindsDB** (AI-powered database integration), allowing seamless integration of bibliographic data with AI-powered queries.

Excited to contribute more to open-source projects!

In folders **1, 2, 3** are my progress presentations in the course "Software Engineering in Practice".
